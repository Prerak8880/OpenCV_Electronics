# Face Tracking System using 2 Servo Motors

(1) I have used 2 servo motors connected to Arduino UNO Rev3 in this module. Using Arduino IDE code is implemented, Python file having source code file.
(2) OpenCV using Haar cascade file for face detection, tracking, and combining Arduino and Pycharm.
(3) One Motor is connected to move in the x-direction and another in the y-direction.
