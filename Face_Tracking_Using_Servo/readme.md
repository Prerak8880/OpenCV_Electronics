# Face Tracking System using 2 Servo Motors

(1) I have used 2 servo motors connected to Arduino UNO Rev3 in this module. Using Arduino IDE code is implemented, Python file having source code file.<br>
(2) OpenCV using Haar cascade file for face detection, tracking, and combining Arduino and Pycharm.<br>
(3) One Motor is connected to move in the x-direction and another in the y-direction.<br>
